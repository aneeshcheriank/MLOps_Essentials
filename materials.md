|Title|Type|Length(Minutes)|Brief Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|[Greedy Optimization Repo](https://github.com/nogibjj/Coursera-MLOps-C2-lab4-greedy-optimization)|Interactive Tutorial|15-30|This GitHub repo features a lab called "Greedy Optimization," aimed at teaching students how to enhance command-line tools and scripts for improved performance and functionality. By engaging with this lab, students will learn to modify a greedy change tool for better robustness and explore error handling and script improvements. They will also work with a traveling salesman algorithm to optimize simulation runs. The lab provides a Python script implementing the greedy coin change algorithm, offering practical experience in working with real-world code.|
|[Linear Optimization at Scale Repo](https://github.com/noahgift/tornado_rabbitmq_linear_optimization/blob/master/README.md)|Reading - Part 1|15-30|The assigned article presents an insightful introduction to linear optimization using the Pyomo library in Python. However, it is important to note that the code examples provided are outdated. Students should focus on understanding the underlying concepts and principles of linear optimization, rather than relying on the specific code implementations presented. For those who are motivated to delve deeper, it is highly recommended to consult the latest Pyomo documentation to access up-to-date information about the SDK. By doing so, students can stay informed about recent developments and best practices in utilizing the Pyomo library for solving complex optimization problems in various fields.|

|[Operations Reseach Repo](https://github.com/noahgift/or)|Interactive Tutorial|15-30|This source code repository, Operations Research, provides a collection of operations research algorithms, with its origins tracing back to a course taught by Dr. David L. Woodruff at the UC Davis MBA program. The repository contains valuable resources, including a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution using randomized start and greedy path approaches, Colab Notebook exploring greedy algorithms and random choices, and a series of YouTube lectures on business analytics. Students are encouraged to engage with these materials and actively participate in the exercises provided.\n\nPlease note that to run the code, you'll need to utilize Docker for containerization. Detailed instructions for building and running the container are provided in the README. Additionally, you'll find examples of greedy algorithms and random choices, as well as YouTube resources on business analytics and containerization. By exploring and experimenting with the contents of this repository, students can deepen their understanding of operations research concepts and techniques, further enhancing their problem-solving skills in various domains.|
|[Introduction to Machine Lenaring Problem Framing](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/problem-framing)|Reading|45-60 Minutes|In this assigned reading, you'll learn how to assess whether machine learning (ML) is a suitable approach for addressing a specific problem. This course, provided by Google, covers essential concepts and techniques for outlining an ML solution. You'll gain valuable insights into the initial stages of designing and implementing ML solutions. Understanding problem framing is crucial for successful ML projects, as it ensures that the chosen approach aligns with the problem at hand and the desired outcomes.|
