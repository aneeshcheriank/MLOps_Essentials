|[Greedy Optimization Repo](https://github.com/nogibjj/Coursera-MLOps-C2-lab4-greedy-optimization)|Interactive Tutorial|15-30|This GitHub repo features a lab called "Greedy Optimization," aimed at teaching students how to enhance command-line tools and scripts for improved performance and functionality. By engaging with this lab, students will learn to modify a greedy change tool for better robustness and explore error handling and script improvements. They will also work with a traveling salesman algorithm to optimize simulation runs. The lab provides a Python script implementing the greedy coin change algorithm, offering practical experience in working with real-world code.|

|[Linear Optimization at Scale Repo](https://github.com/noahgift/tornado_rabbitmq_linear_optimization/blob/master/README.md)|Reading - Part 1|15-30|The assigned article presents an insightful introduction to linear optimization using the Pyomo library in Python. However, it is important to note that the code examples provided are outdated. Students should focus on understanding the underlying concepts and principles of linear optimization, rather than relying on the specific code implementations presented. For those who are motivated to delve deeper, it is highly recommended to consult the latest Pyomo documentation to access up-to-date information about the SDK. By doing so, students can stay informed about recent developments and best practices in utilizing the Pyomo library for solving complex optimization problems in various fields.|
